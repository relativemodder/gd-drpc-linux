Shotout to this man: [https://github.com/0e4ef622/wine-discord-ipc-bridge](https://github.com/0e4ef622/wine-discord-ipc-bridge)

This is a mod to work with the Linux Discord Rich Presence IPC Bridge.

It's **recommended** to have [arRPC](https://github.com/OpenAsar/arrpc?tab=readme-ov-file) installed on your system and **not** running in container (such as **Flatpak** etc.)
